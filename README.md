## **Data:**

Dataset can be found in the data folder as diamonsds_predict.csv. This dataset is also available in Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/dataptmad0420), though there may be some restrictions.

## **Method:**

Method followed the next steps: 
1. data loading: 
2. ml preprocessing: how to use scikit-learn's Pipiline and ColumnTransformer, one of the best practices for composing preprocessing and modeling in a single and elegand class... pay attention as it is hard to understand...
3. train a simple model: first, lets train a simple model using holdout, train - test split...
The model used is: RandomForestRegressor
4. check model performance on test and train data¶
5. check model performance using cross validation¶
6. optimize model using grid search
7. prepare submission

## **Deliverables:**

A GitHub repository, preferably named: **ih_datamadpt0420_project_m2**, including:

- `data_analysis_report.ipynb` file that holds the results of challenge 1. You may add to the `notebooks/` folder any work/draft notebooks, data or files used to build your report.

- `README.md` file explaining the job done, your main conclusions and the **link** to the Kaggle competition [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dataptmad0420).

### **Result: see notebooks/ and key outcomes below**

Tree test has been used and results show a good fit with model.
